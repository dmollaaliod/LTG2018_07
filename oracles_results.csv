It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells. Genome-wide profiling revealed that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemia and carcinoma We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues.

In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD. In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.

5311cdcce3eabad021000007,"A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2, …,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology. Our main contributions are 1) the assumption that the intensity of a chromosome pixel is sampled from multiple Gaussian components [Gaussian mixture model (GMM)] such that each component corresponds to one chromosome class, and 2) the initialization of the GMM model using the emission information of each chromosome class. This is feasible since prior to the M-FISH image acquirement, we already know which chromosome class is emitting to each of the five M-FISH image channels. The method has been tested on a large number of M-FISH images and an overall accuracy of 89.85% is reported. Our method is unsupervised and presents higher classification accuracy even when it is compared with common supervised based methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes. The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining. Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal cancers were stained for CD133 expression. IHC images were acquired and image coordinates recorded. Slides were subsequently hybridized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes. FISH images were taken at the previously recorded positions allowing for direct comparison of protein expression and gene copy number signals within the same cells/tissue areas. Relocation, acquisition of the IHC and FISH images, and enumeration of FISH signals in the immunophenotyped tumour areas were done in an automated fashion. RESULTS: Automated FISH analysis was performed on 13 different colon cancer samples that had been stained for CD133; each sample was scored for MYC, ZNF217 and Chromosome 6 in CD133 positive and negative glands. From the 13 cases four (31%) showed amplification for the MYC oncogene and seven of 13 (54%) cases were amplified for ZNF217.",0.0765,"he study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images.

When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave the lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of different SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation methods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least Angle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared.

56c0708eef6e39474100001f,"Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.",0.12052,"Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.

CisMiner allows to perform a blind search of CRMs without any prior information about target CRMs nor limitation in the number of motifs. CisMiner tackles the combinatorial complexity of genome-wide cis-regulatory module extraction using a natural representation of motif combinations as itemsets and applying the Top-Down Fuzzy Frequent- Pattern Tree algorithm to identify significant itemsets. the optimal choice of method varies depending on species and composition of the sequences in question. When discriminating CRMs from non-coding regions, those methods considering evolutionary conservation have a stronger predictive power than methods designed to be run on a single genome. Different CRM representations and search strategies rely on different CRM properties, and different methods can complement one another. For example, some favour homotypical clusters of binding sites, while others perform best on short CRMs. Furthermore, most methods appear to be sensitive to the composition and structure of the genome to which they are applied.

5319ac7fb166e2b806000033,"Recently, invadopodia have been increasingly recognized as important drivers of local invasion in metastasis. Invadopodia are basally-localized, actin-rich structures that concentrate protease activity to areas of the cell in contact with the extracellular matrix. We recently found that the transcription factor Twist1, a central regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promotes invadopodia formation via upregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression and activity. The Twist1 transcription factor is known to promote tumor metastasis and induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Here, we report that Twist1 is capable of promoting the formation of invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions for extracellular matrix degradation. In a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), besides changing their adhesive repertoire, cancer cells employ developmental processes to gain migratory and invasive properties that involve a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the concomitant formation of membrane protrusions required for invasive growth.

Junctin is a calsequestrin binding protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles. In the present study, the human cardiac junctin cDNA has been cloned by human heart cDNA library screening and RT-PCR, and the cDNA sequence has been determined.

This often leads to the assumption that BAFF is mostly a B cell factor with a specific role in autoimmunity. Focus on BAFF and autoimmunity, driven by pharmaceutical successes with the recent approval of a novel targeted therapy Belimumab, has relegated other potential roles of BAFF to the background. Far from being SLE-specific, the BAFF system has a much broader relevance in infection, cancer and allergy.  transfer of CD40 ligand (CD40L) holds promise as a novel therapy for lymphoid malignancies and a number of solid carcinomas because of its multiple anti-tumor activities. However, membrane-bound CD40L can be cleaved into a soluble form, sCD40L, which contributes to systemic inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, and induces survival signals in the absence of protein synthesis block, suggesting a deleterious side effect of CD40L gene therapy. We generated a plasmid encoding non-cleavable human CD40L mutant (pcDNA3.1+-CD40L-M) to determine the direct anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in CD40-positive lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, to verify activation of immature dentritic cells (DCs) by co-cultivation with the transfected A549 cells and to evaluate the lower expression of sCD40L relative to that of wild-type CD40L (CD40L-WT) transfectant in cell-free supernatants. These studies suggest that gene transfer of the membrane-stable CD40L mutant into CD40-positive cells may provide an efficient and safe method to treat non-small cell lung cancer  Immunotherapy applying ex vivo-generated and tumor antigen-loaded dentritic cells has been successfully introduced in clinical vaccination protocols and has proven to be feasible and effective in some patients.

The authors will review novel insights in antigen loading, activation and migration of dentritic cells and their impact on the application of ex vivo-generated dentritic cell vaccines.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.  (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein.

To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides.

LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination.

532c0c21d6d3ac6a3400001b," a popular tool for virtual screening of libraries to identify novel active substances that can be potentially developed into drugs. While they have been applied for years on common drug targets, their application in the discovery of protein-protein interaction inhibitors remains limited. This review describes current pharmacophore modelling methods applied in the discovery of novel inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions. We first address the mimicry of protein-protein interactions with their respective inhibitors as observed in crystal structure complexes. This mimicry can be exploited to derive a pharmacophore query from protein-protein complex structures. We then discuss several cases where pharmacophore queries were utilized for the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors of their respective protein-protein interaction targets. Our results demonstrate that there are significant variations in the success of protein-based pharmacophore models to reproduce native contacts and consequently native ligand poses dependent on the details of the pharmacophore generation process. We show that the generation of optimized protein-based pharmacophore models is a promising approach for ligand pose prediction and pose rankings pharmacophore model does not describe a real molecule or a real association of functional groups but illustrates a molecular recognition of a biological target shared by a group of compounds. Pharmacophores also represent the spatial arrangement of essential interactions in a receptor-binding pocket. Structure based pharmacophores (SBPs) can work both with a free (apo) structure or a macromolecule-ligand complex (holo) structure.

All individually tested compounds produced rapid and readily reversible concentration-dependent inhibition. The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors",0.18371,The ability of hexamethonium (C6) to reverse the neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine (Tc) Isoflurane and sevoflurane enhance the receptor blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

553d0c1df321868558000014,"An unusual feature of the Diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells. At a number of loci in Drosophila, this pairing can significantly influence gene expression. Such influences were first detected within the bithorax complex (BX-C) by E.B. Lewis, who coined the term transvection to describe them. Most cases of transvection involve the action of enhancers in trans. At several loci deletion of the promoter greatly increases this action in trans, suggesting that enhancers are normally tethered in cis by the promoter region. Transvection can also occur by the action of silencers in trans or by the spreading of position effect variegation from rearrangements having heterochromatic breakpoints to paired unrearranged chromosomes. Although not demonstrated, other cases of transvection may involve the production of joint RNAs by trans-splicing. Several cases of transvection require Zeste, a DNA-binding protein that is thought to facilitate homolog interactions by self-aggregation. Genes showing transvection can differ greatly in their response to pairing disruption. In several cases, transvection appears to require intimate synapsis of homologs. However, in at least one case (transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region of the BX-C), transvection is independent of synapsis within and surrounding the interacting gene. The latter example suggests that transvection could well occur in organisms that lack somatic pairing. In support of this, transvection-like phenomena have been described in a number of different organisms, including plants, fungi, and mammals Pairing-dependent interallelic complementation was first described for the Ultrabithorax gene of the bithorax-complex in Drosophila by Lewis and cited as an example of a new phenomenon that Lewis called the ""trans-vection effect."" Several different kinds of pairing-dependent gene expression have been observed in Drosophila, and it is now clear that a variety of different molecular mechanisms probably underlie the changes in gene expression that are observed after disrupting chromosome pairing. Transvection in the bithorax-complex appears to result from the ability of cis-regulatory elements to regulate transcription of the promoter on the homologous chromosome. The same phenomenon appears to be responsible for pairing-dependent interallelic complementation at numerous other genes in Drosophila. Some transvection effects are dependent on the presence of wild-type or specific mutant forms of the protein encoded by the zeste trans-regulatory gene, but other transvection effects are zeste-independent. The ease with which chromosome aberrations can disrupt transvection also varies widely among different genes Enhancers have been defined operationally as cis-regulatory sequences that can stimulate transcription of RNA polymerase-II-transcribed genes over large distances and even when located downstream of the gene. Recently, it has become evident that enhancers can also stimulate transcription in trans if they are brought into close proximity to the promoter/gene. These reports provide clues to the mechanism of remote enhancer action. In addition, the findings, together with genetic studies in Drosophila, strongly suggest that enhancer action in trans could underlie phenomena such as 'transvection', where one chromosome affects gene expression in the paired homolog",0.57102,"An unusual feature of the Diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells.

Some transvection effects are dependent on the presence of wild-type or specific mutant forms of the protein encoded by the zeste trans-regulatory gene, but other transvection effects are zeste-independent. The ease with which chromosome aberrations can disrupt transvection also varies widely among different genes Special attention is paid to the transvection effect (synapsis-dependent interaction between white and zeste genes), cis-acting regulatory elements and the behaviour of the white genes introduced into the genome by P element-mediated DNA transformation",0.62539

Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways.",0.57212

NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins. A fluorescently labeled form of NS3 was used to investigate this interaction through fluorescence polarization binding assays. Results from this assay support interactions that include a 1:1 complex formed between NS3 and NS5B. Contradictory results have been reported regarding NS3 in RNA synthesis. To investigate the effect of NS3 on classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) activity and NS3-NS5B interaction, RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses containing NS5B and either of NS3 protein and the different truncated NS3 mutants were performed, respectively. We found that NS3 stimulated NS5B RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner by binding to NS5 through a NS3 protease domain. Furthermore, mapping important regions of the NS3 protease domain was carried out by deletion mutagenesis, associated with RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Results showed that stimulation of CSFV NS5B RdRp activity was obtained by NS3 binding to NS5B through a 31-amino acid fragment at the N-terminal end of NS3 protease domain, which mediated a specific NS3-NS5B interaction.

51bdd9c2047fa84d1d000002,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective type of autophagy by which specific cytosolic proteins are sent to lysosomes for degradation. Substrate proteins bind to the lysosomal membrane through the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), one of the three splice variants of the lamp2 gene, and this binding is limiting for their degradation via CMA. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective pathway for the degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes. CMA declines with age because of a decrease in the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) type 2A, a lysosomal receptor for this pathway.

The proposed treatment for CCSVI is percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, also known as the 'liberation procedure', which is claimed to improve the blood flow in the brain, thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of MS. Significant improvement of clinical disability in relapsing-remitting patients was (P < 0.001) achieved. Data from a few small case series suggest possible improvement of the clinical course and quality of life by performing percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA) of the stenotic veins. ",0.602

Waves of calcium-induced calcium release occur in a variety of cell types and have been implicated in the origin of cardiac arrhythmias.  Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) has been observed in cardiac myocytes as elementary calcium release events (calcium sparks) associated with the opening of L-type Ca(2+) channels. In heart cells, a tight coupling between the gating of single L-type Ca(2+) channels and ryanodine receptors (RYRs) underlies calcium release. ",0.69134

These account for heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates among sites but do not account for changing within-site rates across lineages (heterotachy). Because of functional constraints, substitution rates vary among the positions of a protein but are usually assumed to be constant at a given site during evolution. The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generally fits a Gamma distribution. Models of sequence evolution were accordingly designed and led to improved phylogenetic reconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy (for ""different speed"" in Greek). Heterotachy occurs when the relative evolutionary rates among sites are not the same across lineages. Sequence alignments are likely to exhibit heterotachy with varying severity because the intensity of purifying selection and adaptive forces at a given amino acid or DNA sequence position is unlikely to be the same in different species.",0.30884,"Heterotachy, the variation of substitution rate at a site across time, is a prevalent phenomenon in nucleotide and amino acid alignments, which may mislead probabilistic-based phylogenetic inferences.

54fc27a896abe38008000002,"In the secretory pathway, quality control for the correct folding of proteins is largely occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), at the earliest possible stage and in an environment where early folding intermediates mix with terminally misfolded species. An elaborate cellular mechanism aims at dividing the former from the latter and promotes the selective transport of misfolded species back into the cytosol, a step called retrotranslocation. During retrotranslocation proteins will become ubiquitinated on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane by dedicated machineries and will be targeted to the proteasome for degradation. The entire process, from protein recognition to final degradation, has been named ER-associated protein degradation, or simply ERAD. From the many cellular processes, Cdc48 is involved in, its function in endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD) is understood best. This quality control process for proteins of the secretory pathway scans protein folding and discovers misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the organelle, destined for folding of these proteins and their further delivery to their site of action. Misfolded lumenal and membrane proteins of the ER are detected by chaperones and lectins and retro-translocated out of the ER for degradation.  The quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells ensures that newly synthesized proteins that fail to fold into the correct conformation or unassembled orphan subunits of oligomeric proteins are rapidly eliminated by proteolytic degradation. This entails the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol followed by their destruction by the cytosolic ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. While this mechanism effectively prevents the cellular accumulation of non-functional or unwanted endogenous proteins, it renders the cell vulnerable to certain viruses and toxins that are able to subvert this degradative mechanism for their own advantage.",0.52794,"In the secretory pathway, quality control for the correct folding of proteins is largely occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), at the earliest possible stage and in an environment where early folding intermediates mix with terminally misfolded species. An elaborate cellular mechanism aims at dividing the former from the latter and promotes the selective transport of misfolded species back into the cytosol, a step called retrotranslocation. During retrotranslocation proteins will become ubiquitinated on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane by dedicated machineries and will be targeted to the proteasome for degradation. The entire process, from protein recognition to final degradation, has been named ER-associated protein degradation, or simply ERAD.

To validate the potential of SPARC as a therapeutic target, we examined the effect of the knockdown of SPARC with SPARC-specific siRNA on the growth of human melanoma cell lines. SPARC siRNAs exerted a potent knockdown effect. Silencing of SPARC resulted in growth inhibition with G(1) arrest accompanied by accumulation of p21, a G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Moreover, the induction of p53 was observed in MeWo cells, but not in CRL1579 cells. Conditioned media containing SPARC from MeWo cells could not restore the growth of SPARC-silenced MeWo cells.

Type 1 VHL is predominantly associated with large deletion or truncation mutations which result in an encoded protein with very little or no activity. It is associated with retinal and CNS hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma but not pheochromocytoma. Type 2 is usually associated with missense mutations encoding a protein with limited activity and includes pheochromocytoma. It is further classified into three other subtypes (2A, 2B, 2C) based on the presence of hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma. Visceral cysts in the kidney, pancreas and epididymis, nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors which often show distinctive clear cell cytology, endolymphatic sac tumors and head and neck paragangliomas are well recognized but less common presenting features.

Pre-clinical studies suggest that vaccination with combination of primary DC subsets, such as myeloid and plasmacytoid blood DCs (mDCs and pDCs, respectively), may result in stronger clinical responses. However, it is a challenge to obtain high enough numbers of primary DCs for immunotherapy, since their frequency in blood is very low. We therefore explored the possibility to generate them from hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Here, we show that by inhibiting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor with its antagonist StemRegenin 1 (SR1), clinical-scale numbers of functional BDCA2(+)BDCA4(+) pDCs, BDCA1(+) mDCs, and BDCA3(+)DNGR1(+) mDCs can be efficiently generated from human CD34(+) HPCs. The ex vivo-generated DCs were phenotypically and functionally comparable to peripheral blood DCs. They secreted high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers following stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Further, the odent models of prostate cancer have served as valuable preclinical models to evaluate novel treatments and understand malignant disease progression. In particular, a transgenic rat autochthonous model of prostate cancer using the SV40 large T antigen expressed under a prostate-specific probasin promoter was previously developed as a model of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (TRAP). In the current report, we backcrossed this strain to the Lewis strain, an inbred rat strain better characterized for immunological analyses. We demonstrate that Lewis transgenic rats (Lew-TRAP) developed prostate adenocarcinomas with 100% penetrance by 25 weeks of age.

This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory. In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury Along with β-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid β-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid β-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, γ-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that γ-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure Aggregated forms of Aβ have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the Aβ levels by inhibiting γ-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease. Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of γ-secretase results in Notch-related side effects.

Type 1 ""classic"" Pfeiffer syndrome involves individuals with mild manifestations including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia and finger and toe abnormalities; it is associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without a cloverleaf skull.  Recently, based on clinical findings, the disorder has been divided into three subtypes: type 1, characterized by mild expression; type 2, in which clover leaf skull deformity and multiple congenital anomalies are present at birth; and type 3, which is similar to type 2, but lacks the presence of the clover leaf skull at birth.  Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important.

56c3104c50c68dd416000001,"We have identified a new member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, growth/differentiation factor-10 (GDF-10), which is highly related to bone morphogenetic protein-3 (BMP-3). The nucleotide sequence of GDF-10 encodes a predicted protein of 476 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 52,000. The GDF-10 polypeptide contains a potential signal sequence for secretion, a putative RXXR proteolytic processing site, and a carboxy-terminal domain with considerable homology to other known members of the TGF-beta superfamily. In the mature carboxy-terminal domain GDF-10 is more homologous to BMP-3 (83% amino acid sequence identity) than to any other previously identified TGF-beta family member. GDF-10 also shows significant homology to BMP-3 (approximately 30% amino acid sequence identity) in the pro- region of the molecule. Based on these sequence comparisons, GDF-10 and BMP-3 define a new subgroup within the larger TGF-beta superfamily. By Northern analysis, GDF-10 mRNA was detected primarily in murine uterus, adipose tissue, and brain and to a lesser extent in liver and spleen. In addition, GDF-10 mRNA was present in both neonatal and adult bone samples, with higher levels being detected in calvaria than in long bone.

The prevalence of ticks on birds varies over years, season, locality and different bird species. The prevalence of ticks on different species depends mainly on the degree of feeding on the ground. In Europe, the Turdus spp., especially the blackbird, Turdus merula, appears to be most important for harboring ticks. Birds can easily cross barriers, like fences, mountains, glaciers, desserts and oceans, which would stop mammals, and they can move much faster than the wingless hosts. Birds can potentially transport tick-borne pathogens by transporting infected ticks, by being infected with tick-borne pathogens and transmit the pathogens to the ticks, and possibly act as hosts for transfer of pathogens between ticks through co-feeding. The genus Flavivirus currently consists of approximately 80 single-strand positive-sense RNA viruses. These replicate in a range of hosts including myriad vertebrate, insect, and tick species. As a consequence of this broad host range, the majority of flaviviruses can be propagated in most vertebrate and insect cell cultures. This ability to infect arthropods and vertebrates usually is essential for maintenance of these viruses in nature. But recently, there has been the discovery of a number of flaviviruses that infect mosquitoes but not vertebrates.

58946d6e7d9090f353000005,"The analysis of chromatin structure is essential for the understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MPE-Fe(II) relative to MNase. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias.

Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation.

58965ed478275d0c4a000010,"Exome sequencing studies have identified multiple genes harboring de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including TBR1, a master regulator of cortical development. We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes. Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. T-brain-1 (TBR1) is a brain-specific T-box transcription factor.
